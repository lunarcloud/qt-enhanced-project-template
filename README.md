Qt Enhanced Project
============================

Qt project template wizards for starting new projects that are deployable and cross-platform.
A great way to jumpstart a project.

Qt 4 & 5
------
Projects will be compatible and enhanced by Qt5 features.

Because we value cross-platform compatibility, Qt4 should be supported until KDE has transitioned to Qt5,
otherwise, we would effectively be incompatible with Linux.


Install
-------
git clone into the qt creator's templates/wizards folder.
This way updating and commiting fixes will be a snap!

### Windows
Starting where your Qt Creator application is installed:
`\share\qtcreator\templates\wizards`

### OS X
`~/.config/Nokia/qtcreator/templates/wizards`

### Linux
`/usr/share/qtcreator/templates/wizards`

So you may install it via:

`cd /usr/share/qtcreator/templates/wizards && sudo git clone https://github.com/lunarcloud/qt-enhanced-project-template.git`
